# Overview

This program is a simple text-based version of Blackjack that was created with the programming language Python. 
It includes most features of the actual game of Blackjack with the exception of insurance.

This software was written to help demonstrate my current level of mastery of the Python language.
It uses many of the different things that I had learned about Python, such as, classes, functions, variables, data structures, etc

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Insurance - allows players to protect their bet if the dealer shows an Ace.
* Create a better display for the hands, possibly using the arcade python library.
* Fixing outstanding issues. The first issue I encountered was the code occasionally crashes due to the points reverting to a null value. The second issue was that the bets/loses would be double what the player originally asked. The third issue is that the game only lasts for one deck before crashing.
